 * The assignment for this week is to implement the missing methods of two classes: CreditAccount
 * and RewardsCreditAccount. If you are going to submit through Eclipse, you should create a new
 * project and have only the files for this homework assignment in the project. Comments are
 * provided for some methods to help you figure out what should be done. Other methods (such as
 * setters and getters) should be straight-forward.
